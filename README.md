## :scroll: Description
I chose a slightly more "nook" version for this adoption application challenge. A way of highlighting these cats and dogs who, for many, have accompanied us during this particular period.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I would like to take advantage of this challenge to experience JetpackCompose.
For some time now I've been developing with Flutter and I want to see if Jetpack Compose can get me back to developing interfaces in Android.
Besides the completion of the pathway, I think I took about 8 hours to develop this application.
